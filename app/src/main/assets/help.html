<h3>
    How To Use
</h3>
<pre>
    The application asks for location permissions so that the map can center on the user as most people
    would like to know what the weather is like around them. Add markers and locations to the map by long
    clicking on it. The locations will show up as a horizontal list of coordinates at the bottom of the map.
    Clicking on a marker or a location item will redirect the user to the City screen where relevant
    weather data is available.
